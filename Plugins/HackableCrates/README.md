# HackableCrates

The HackableCrates plugin provides easily configurable functionality to Rust's time-based hackable crates.

## Default (Plugin) Configuration

Below is the default plugin configuration settings should you need to reset your configuration.

```json
{
  "(1). Enable the HackableCrates plugin?": true,
  "(2). Enable a non-default crate timer?": false,
  "(3). If enabled, set the custom timer's time (minutes).": 15.0,
  "(4). Revert unlock time to default on plugin unload?": true,
  "(5). Announce when a crate starts to be unlocked?": false,
  "(6). Announce when a crate has finished unlocking?": false
}
```

## Default (Language) Configuration

Below is the default language configuration settings should you need to reset your language file.

```json
{
  "NewUnlockEvent": "A hackable crate has begun to be unlocked!",
  "EndUnlockEvent": "A hackable crate has just unlocked!"
}
```

To use colour codes use `[#HEXCODE]Text[/#]` to do such; for example, `[#123ABC]Text[/#]`.
