# Rust Plugins - Archived

This repository is now archived in favor of the [Essentials](https://github.com/ReeceDeveloper/Essentials) repository.
To allow for better integration and better expansion of the codebase I have decided to rewrite & rebrand the plugins
within this repository. All plugins in this repository are now in their final state and the development branch has
been deleted.
