# Rust Plugins

This repository contains plugins developed for the popular survival game Rust. To use these plugins you will
need uMod (OxideMod) installed on your Rust server. Note: doing such will not allow your Rust server to appear
in the Community or Official tab of Rust servers; your Rust server will be listed under "modded," even if you
have no plugins actually installed or active.

## Support

Support for the code (i.e., modifying these plugins) is not provided by me (the developer). However, support
requests in relation to the installation, configuration, and usage of these plugins can be found in the Discord
linked below in the `README.md`.

## Contributions

If you find bugs (in production!) please feel free to open an issue; if you have the initiative to fix the bug
yourself you may do such and open a pull request. If you have suggestions for plugins that can be developed you
may post those suggestions by joining the Discord linked below in the `README.md`. Lastly, if you find bad code
(in production!) I apologise, please correct me (hopefully in a constructive wy).

## Development Branch

By downloading plugins from the development branch you acknowledge and accept all risks of bugs associated with
those plugins. Whilst all things pushed to development should be functional, they may have unfixed bugs that
came from "end-of-the-day" commits where work will be resumed at a later date.
